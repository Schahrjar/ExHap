# ExHap
The tool retrievs homozygosity haplotypes from a multi-sample VCF file. Manily developed for exome variants of rare disorder patients to investigate if a common pathogenic mutation is a recurrent or founder variant.

> [!NOTE]
> Find shared homozygous haplotypes in any cohort of genomic variants, visualise haplotypes, and calculate age of the most recent common acestor of the variant of interest.

## 🔧 Features
- Identifies all individual ROH per sample
- Detects homozygous haplotypes shared among samples
- Works on any genome assembly (e.g. hg38 or hg19)
- Requires Python
